X run notebook as right UID
X mount notebook home based on user $HOME
  * done based on user UID
- pin versions of jupyterhub/notebook
X mount a shared directory per course  (done, /course)
- copy nbgrader_config.py to user
X create profilespawner for courses
- Request Aalto SSL cert
X how to we restart
- Use kubernetes proxy instead of jupyterhub hub proxy
X set uid
- set default exchange to /srv/nbgrader/exchange
- course management
  - script to create course
X limit ssh key to only run the init function
- set up kubernetes pod logging.
  - logs: how to get logs of a container that fails immediately?, or
    old container?  Needed for eventually debugging
- "kubectl exec -it ... bash" does not work on user pods, because the
  user home directory has been moved, and docker tries to
  unconditionally cd before running your command.
- /srv/jupyterhub is mounted from jhnas:/vol/jupyter/admin/hubdata/.
  But the hub has root_squash, so these are currently owned by
  nobody/nogroup.  Fix the security.
- Change to use kubernetes as the ingress proxy, instead of the
  jupyterhub built in one.


Epics:
- create sigle user imeage
- configure JH with all the user and spawn hooks



Delayed:
- config JH code version
- config notebook version



MVP stories:
- for student, mount /user and /exchange based on course
